# DIP
The journey of Digital Image Processing

The first file named DIP Basics contain the fundamental codes to show the image in MATLAB
The file also contains methods to convert it to grayscale, change its channel to only red and finally turn it into Black and White image.

The second file named HistogramEqualisation contains two approaches to equalise an image, the first is by directly using built in keywords and the other is by using mathematical logic to equalise an image and give its represntation through a histogram
