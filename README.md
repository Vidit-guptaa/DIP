# DIP
The journey of Digital Image Processing

The first file named DIP Basics contain the fundamental codes to show the image in MATLAB
The file also contains methods to convert it to grayscale, change its channel to only red and finally turn it into Black and White image.

The second file named HistogramEqualisation contains two approaches to equalise an image, the first is by directly using built in keywords and the other is by using mathematical logic to equalise an image and give its represntation through a histogram

The third lab consisted of 4 tasks enclosed in the experiment 3 folder, namely the implementation of the Bit Slicing method and the Shannon Hertley formula to calculate the entropy of an image, the other two were Tambola ticket generator which as name suggests generates random tambola tickets precise to the original format, the final task included the implementation of Wavelet Transform method where four kinds of output occured, which were Approximation, Horizontal, Vertical and Detailed which are representation of filter passing such as Low-Low, Low-High, High-Low and High-High on an image.
